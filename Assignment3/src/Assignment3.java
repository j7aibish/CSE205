hard drive in order to emotionally hurt them is indecent
and is unacceptable.

or viewing another persons data is wrong, and is why we use
strong passwords on our machines.

someone's life. No one should ever get away with identity
theft, especially not over computer technology.

The company that puts out software should be paid for their work, I
myself would be upset if someone stole my software without proper license.
