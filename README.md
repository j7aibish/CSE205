======

What does this repository contain?
	-Assignments for Object Oriented Programming Class 205
	-Examples for this class by me
	-Examples for this class provided by the instructor


WARNING
=======

I do not recommend you copying my code because...
	-You will not learn anything via plagiarizing my work
	-If you found this, chances are your classmates have as well
	-Your code will easily match my coding style, you will get caught, the Professors are aware of my GitHub
	-Just changing variable names does not fool anybody

Instead, you may be able to, and I sugguest you do, LEARN something from these examples.
